-> Start by training to control the boat with the remote

-> Make a program so that the boat moves its rudder in a certain way when it's IMU is calirated and is ready to go.
-> Same when the robot starts to receive proper GPS Data.

First test : Cap following

-> Edit the program so that it saves the logs in different files each time.
-> Maybe try it both with PD controler and with only proportionnal controler
-> Have the program run for a whole minute.
-> Once the programs works as intended without tacking, test it in a tacking configuration.

	The canal might be a bit too narrow for this test and the boat might deflect toward its sides. Therefore a test 
in a wider space might be more relevant here or at least easier. Particularly, tacking might be particularly 
difficult to operate in the canal even though it might also make a good challenge. To operate tacking, the usage of
a position-based method rather than a time-nased method should be considered as this would allow to avoid the canal
's sides. However such use of tacking would most lickelye be easier to implement with line following. Thus the 
question of whether implementing a follow cap function with tacking can and should be asked.


Second test : Point reaching

-> Define a proper way to decide when the boat has reached its point
-> First only ask the boat to reach a certain point at least 15 meters away without tacking
-> Then have the boat do the same in a tacking situation
-> Finally have the boat follow some trajectory with several points in a proper order.

	This test is mostly intended to test the proper use and functionning of the GPS as as for the GPS, this 
mission can be done more effectively using a linefollowing algorithm.

Third test : Line following

-> Most important test and the most relevant in the canal as it is a pretty narrow environment for the boat.
-> Test it at first on a long distance without tacking with a line in the center of the canal, and check that the 
boat does indeed stay in the middle of the canal.
-> Then same test in a tacking situation.
-> Then we can do a test with a trajectory made of several lines as following.

	The most important tet since being able to follow a line with the boat is our main objective here.

Fourth Test : Station keeping

-> Program for this mission not done yet but should be easy to do using line following.
-> Have the boat maintain a certain position for a long ennough time (For example 5 minutes).

	Bonus test and mission to confirm that we are able to control our boat finely.
